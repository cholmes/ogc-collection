# ogc-collection
Experiment to make a 'Collection' building block that can be used as a static cloud file.

## In this repo

 * [OGC Collection Spec](ogc-collection-spec.md) - first attempt at extracting the Collection JSON from OGC API to be a standalone file that 
 can be used statically.
 * [OGC Records GeoJSON spec](ogc-record-geojson-spec.md) - first attempt at pulling out the Record content model from OGC API - Records.
 * [Examples](examples/) - Matched examples showing both Record and Collection instantiations of the same data.
